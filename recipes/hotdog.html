    <p>A hot dog[1][2] (less commonly spelled hotdog[3]) is a dish consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun.[4] The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, also just called frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.[5] Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide. Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce,[citation needed] and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon, and olives.[citation needed] Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket</p>
